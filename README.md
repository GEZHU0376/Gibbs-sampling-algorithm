# Gibbs-sampling-algorithm
 Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm application

Gibbs sampling is the ideal alternative method when direct sampling is difficult. As a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms,
Gibbs sampling can obtain similar observations from a specific multivariate probability distribution. Application of Gibbs sampling 
range from integral computation to obtain the approximate value of joint distribution. Also, Gibbs sampling is used as a mean 
statistical interface for Bayesian statistical interface. 

*Gibbs sampling is randomized algorithms so the random module in python3 was called.
